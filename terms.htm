<p>8.3. Monies held in your account shall not attract any interest.</p>
<p>8.4. Accounts in which there have been no transactions (trading / withdrawals / deposits), for a set period of 12 months, will be considered by the Company as being dormant accounts.

There will be no charge if the free balance is zero. Consequently, all accounts with a zero free balance will be closed.</p>
<p>8.5. The Company may, at any time, set off any positive balances in your account against any amount owed by you to us.</p>
<p>8.6. The Company may, at its sole discretion, impose volume or other limits on customer accounts.</p>

<p>9.5. In the case of suspected or fraudulent payment, including use of stolen credit cards, or any other fraudulent activity or attempted fraudulent activity (including any charge-back or other reversal of a payment), we reserve the right to immediately block a user's account, terminate a user's account, seize the funds within a user's account, refund to users only their initial deposits, reverse any pay-out made and recover any pending balance. We shall be entitled to inform any relevant authorities or entities (including credit reference agencies) of any payment fraud or otherwise unlawful activity, take legal action against a user, and may employ collection services to recover payments. However, under no circumstances shall the Company be liable for any unauthorized use of credit cards, irrespective of whether or not the credit cards were reported stolen.</p>

<h3>27. Anti-money Laundering</h3>
<p>Ultimate-traders.com does not tolerate money laundering and supports the fight against money launderers. Ultimate-traders.com follows the guidelines set by the UK’s Joint Money Laundering Steering Group. The UK is a full member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the intergovernmental body whose purpose is to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
<p>Ultimate-traders.com now has policies in place to deter people from laundering money. These policies include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ensuring clients have valid proof of identification</li>
	<li>maintaining records of identification information</li>
	<li>determining that clients are not known or suspected terrorists by checking their names against lists of known or suspected terrorists</li>
	<li>informing clients that the information they provide may be used to verify their identity</li>
	<li>closely following clients’ money transactions</li>
	<li>Not accepting cash, money orders, third party transactions, exchange houses transfers or Western Union transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Money laundering occurs when funds from an illegal/criminal activity are moved through the financial system in such a way as to make it appear that the funds have come from legitimate sources.</p>
<p>Money Laundering usually follows three stages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>firstly, cash or cash equivalents are placed into the financial system</li>
	<li>secondly, money is transferred or moved to other accounts (e.g. futures accounts) through a series of financial transactions designed to obscure the origin of the money (e.g. executing trades with little or no financial risk or transferring account balances to other accounts)</li>
	<li>And finally, the funds are re-introduced into the economy so that the funds appear to have come from legitimate sources (e.g. closing a futures account and transferring the funds to a bank account).</li>
</ul>
<p>Trading accounts are one vehicle that can be used to launder illicit funds or to hide the true owner of the funds. In particular, a trading account can be used to execute financial transactions that help obscure the origins of the funds.</p>
<p>ultimate-traders.com directs funds withdrawals back to the original source of remittance, as a preventative measure.</p>
<p>International Anti-Money Laundering requires financial services institutions to be aware of potential money laundering abuses that could occur in a customer account and implement a compliance program to deter, detect and report potential suspicious activity.</p>
<p>These guidelines have been implemented to protect ultimate-traders.com and its clients. For questions/comments regarding these guidelines, please contact us at support@ultimate-traders.com.</p>
